## Tensorflow + Keras 2.9

The release of the *Deep Learning with R, 2nd Edition* book coincides
with new releases of Tensorflow and Keras. These releases bring many
refinements that allow for more idiomatic and concise R code.

The set of Tensor methods for base R generics has greatly expanded. The
set of R generics that work with Tensorflow Tensors is now quite
extensive:

```{r}
methods(class = "tensorflow.tensor")
```

```{text}
 [1] -           !           !=          [           [<-        
 [6] *           /           &           %/%         %%

```

This means that often, you can write the same code for Tensorflow
Tensors as you would for R arrays. For example, consider this small
function from Chapter 11 of the book:

```{r}
reweight_distribution <-
  function(original_distribution, temperature = 0.5) {
    original_distribution %>%
      { exp(log(.) / temperature) } %>%
      { . / sum(.) }
  }
```

Note that functions like `reweight_distribution` work with both 1D R
vectors and 1D Tensorflow Tensors, since `exp`, `log`, `/`, and `sum`
are all R generics with methods for Tensorflow Tensors.

In the same vain, this Keras release brings with it a refinement to the
way custom class extensions to Keras are defined. Partially inspired by
the new [`R7`](https://rconsortium.github.io/OOP-WG/) syntax, there is a
new family of functions: `new_layer_class`, `new_model_class`,
`new_metric_class`, and so on. This new interface substantially
simplifies the amount of R boilerplate required to define custom Keras
extensions---a pleasant R interface that serves as a facade over the
mechanics of sub-classing Python classes. This new interface is the yang
to the yin of `%py_class%`, a way to mime the Python class definition
syntax in R. Of course, the "raw" api of converting an `R6Class` to
Python via `r_to_py()` is still available for users that require full
control.

This release also brings with it a cornucopia of small improvements
throughout the entire keras R interface: updated `print` and `plot`
methods for models, enhancements to `freeze_weights` and
`load_model_tf`, new exported utilities like `zip_lists` and `%<>%`. And
lets not forget to mention a new family of R functions for modifying the
learning rate during training, with a suite of built-in schedules like
`learning_rate_schedule_cosine_decay`, complemented by an interface for
creating custom schedules with `new_learning_rate_schedule_class`.

You can find the full release notes for the R packages here:

-   [keras](https://github.com/rstudio/keras/releases/tag/v2.9.0)

The R interfaces to keras and tensorflow work by embedding a full Python
process in R (via the reticulate package). For most R users, this is
mostly an irrelevant (and invisible) implementation detail. However, one
of the major benefits of this design is that R users have full access to
everything in both R *and* Python. In other words, the R interface
always has feature parity with the Python interface---anything you can
do with Tensorflow in Python, you can do in R just as easily. This means
that the release notes for the Python releases of Tensorflow are just as
relevant for R users:
